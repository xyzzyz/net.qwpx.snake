* net.qwpx.snake
** what is it?
   this is yet another implementation of old snake game.
** is it any good?
   it compiles, run, and, guess what, you can even play!
** you didn't answer the question!
   all right, all right. on the one hand, it's crap (sorry). on the
   other, i used it to pass a course, and not only once, but twice!
   so, you decide.
** usage
   fire up eclipse, blah blah blah.
** acknowledgments
   i'd like to thank Grzegorz Grudzinski and Paweł Kozioł for giving
   me good grades despite of seeing this program.
** license
   do with it whatever you want, i'll be happy if you let me know that
   you find it interesting (i hope you do), or that you use it (wow,
   what for?).
